41 up to 1m by 1m acrylic paintings on canvas

1997-2001

The themes are: birth, love, death and our relationship to nature. In 1997 Eric Hutchison, Anglican Priest and Jungian analyst, said Birth Dream comes from the collective unconscious. Eric: “The worst thing that can happen with this work is that viewers flip through the paintings. I recommend a day for each painting.” At the C.G. Jung Institute in Zurich the series was considered not suitable for analysis of pathology. A full course has been delivered to groups over seven weekends. Various people have been taken through the series on a one to one basis.
