The pastel drawings are playful and show Basic Shapes [kh do we need to capitalise] stimulated by having been an art educator for children and adults for ca 20 years.

‘Into Art’ gives the link between the basic shapes and art, moving in this case into the set called 'The Thirteen Ladies'. This was influenced by Marija Gimbutas 'The Language of the Goddess'. Her work is now scientifically verified.

Arno Stern is the founder of CEA. He discovered that leaving children free to paint what they wished, their paintings evolved in a very rich way. Stern realised that the scribble phase and much early art is an expression of the organic memory of the child from as early as their inter-uterine development. Presentations by children from my studio have been delivered at Conferences between 2002 – 2006 at the International Association of Pre-, Peri and Postnatal Psychology and Medicine, Heidelberg, as well as a Birthlight. https://www.birthlight.com

I also wrote and delivered a full training course in CEA both in group setting and on a one- to-one basis. The full training is a part time two year course.
