1998-2001

'Living Matter in Rhythm' was stimulated by the first Light Images, which were photographed in 1997 in Switzerland. This is an abstract interpretation of organic matter. The first exhibition of the 'Living Matter in Rhythm' paintings took place in 2001 at Queen's College, Cambridge University, as part of the International Conference 'Light, Colour and Sound for Health in the 21st Century'.
