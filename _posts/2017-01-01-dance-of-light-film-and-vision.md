2004-2017

Already in 1990 I was discovering ways to create the Light Art. Much research followed. The British Library Nature Sound Archive and the International Fund of Animal Welfare gave us permission to use some of their recordings of sounds in nature, to which we created moving light art. This project is raising funds for non-profit WildLife Trusts. The second film 'Dance of Light Vision' places the first in context and includes a section on synaesthesia. Several members of my family experience synaesthesia. Synaesthesia also affected the Light Art Movement, with the work of such people as Thomas Wilfred, John and James Whitley and Kandinsky.

Their work initiated modern art. http://www.rq- lightart.com.
