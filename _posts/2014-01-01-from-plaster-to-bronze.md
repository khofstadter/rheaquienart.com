'From Plaster to Bronze' (2013) is about the bronze casting process of a bust of Lord Mountbatten and is a tribute to my mother. Clara Quien was an outstanding artist of the 20th century and her art is now of historical interest.

Material for an exhibition called 'Linking East and West â€“ Linking Generations' has been prepared. Available also are the life size statues of Mahatma Gandhi and the 'Active Buddha'. They are in plaster and in need of repair.
