The website gives insight into education and psychology through art. The benefits of creativity are explored progressively as a means for self development, processes of individuation and transformation as well as acquiring greater understanding of human development.  

The body of work consist of films, paintings, pastel drawings, a story for children and courses. The various series of artwork start with the light art, which is influenced by the Light Movement originating ca 1920. The work ends with archetypal paintings exploring the themes of birth, love, death and our relationship with nature. The movement is from light into progressively deeper areas of consciousness.

The 'Dance of Light' films were strongly influenced by much time spent in nature observing the light effects in many seasons and places. The paintings and pastel drawings were created for her own pleasure and investigation, with no goal orientation. Each series of work grew naturally out of the other, rather like the Cephalopod mull shell, where each chamber formed as the creature grew. Together they create a whole, yet each series can be enjoyed in its own right.  

In her creativity Rhea Quien was strongly influenced by her training as a Creative Art focalised in Switzerland by Ester Hoffmann and subsequent twelve years of a full time practice, working with both children and adults. She has developed and presented a full training course in Creative Expression Art, as well as courses connected with some of her  art work. Equally important were the twenty years and her experience as a therapist in Educational Kinesiology. Rhea is deeply grateful for what she learned from her teachers, clients young and old, and many who have assisted in her projects.

Prof. Anthony Andreasen said to Rhea, while training her as a Kinesiologist:

“Until the male-female dichotomy is resolved, there will be no peace on earth. We learn more during the first two years of our life then during the whole rest of our life.”

Without the encouragement and assistance of many over the years, this body of artwork would not have been created.

Rhea has an intercontinental background and comes from a family of artists. The creativity is influenced by accurate observation, synaesthesia, dreams and visions and the cultures in both the East and West.
